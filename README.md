ASCR_ENVI
=========

An implementation of the ASCR algorithm in ENVI/ IDL



=====================

This program is an implementation of the ASCR algorithm described on
the paper "Relative Radiometric Normalization of Landsat Multispectran Scanner (MSS) Data Using an Automatic Scattergram-Controlled Regression" By Christopher D. Elvidge, Ding Yuan, Ridgeway D. Weerackoon, and Ross S. Lumetta


IDL/ENVI is a hard enviroment to work with, so we free this code in
hope to be useful in someway if anyone still uses IDL


If you can implement it in some other language please do it. Don't
download this code if you want to keep your inner peace, current
life or wife.
